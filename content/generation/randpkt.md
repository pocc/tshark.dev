## About

randpkt is a tool used to generate [fuzzed](https://owasp.org/www-community/Fuzzing) packets for a specific protocol or randomly from a list. While randpkt has a more limited feature set than [similar tools](#further-reading), it is only has 4 flags and generates packets quickly.

`randpktdump` is available as an [extcap interface](/capture/sources/extcap_interfaces/) if you want to tshark to treat this generator as if it were an interface.

## Caveats

* On <i class="fab fa-windows"></i><b>Windows</b>, the default is to not install randpkt. You must select randpkt manually during [installation](/setup/install/).
* The `tcp` option uses token-ring instead of ethernet at layer 2. To get packets using the eth/ip/tcp stack, use `giop`, `tdp`, or `bgp`.
* If you set `-b`, byte counts will vary wildly *up to* this byte count ceiling.
* [~~randpkt -r crashes for -c > 1~~](https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=15627)

## Examples

### Save to pcap

In this asciicast, we'll create pcap with 100 ethernet-II frames and then read it with tshark.

<script id="asciicast-235407" src="https://asciinema.org/a/235407.js" async></script>

To get an idea of possible traffic, [this capture](/pcaps/randpkt_all.pcap) contains a fuzzed packet of every available type (2019).

### stdout

If you write to stdout, it will write raw pcap-formatted packet bytes (i.e. looks like �M�0Ϻ�ZR�d%sX�˯B). If you are using stdout, you are sending this onto another utility like tshark.

```bash
# Send 4 ARP frames to tshark
$ randpkt -t arp -c 4 - | tshark -r -
    1   0.000000 00:00:32:25:0f:ff → Broadcast    ARP 3873 Unknown ARP opcode 0x25dc
    2   1.000000 00:00:32:25:0f:ff → Broadcast    ARP 3690 Unknown ARP opcode 0xbb97
    3   2.000000 00:00:32:25:0f:ff → Broadcast    ARP 4618 Unknown ARP opcode 0x8f78
    4   3.000000 00:00:32:25:0f:ff → Broadcast    ARP 1204 Unknown ARP opcode 0x6c41
```
