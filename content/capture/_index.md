When trying to find the root of a network problem, it helps to look at the packets that might be a symptom.
In order to look at these packets, you must first capture them. This section covers setting up many types of interfaces
and how to limit the capture size.

<!-- This looks bad because it's incomplete. Do not include yet.
This tshark command combines multiple elements that may be relevant to your capture (eventually all of these will be links):
