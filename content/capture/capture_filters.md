## Capture Filters

Capture filters are used to decrease the size of captures by filtering out packets before they are added. Capture filters are based on [BPF syntax](http://biot.com/capstats/bpf.html), which [tcpdump](https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsug_html_chunked/AppToolstcpdump.html) also uses. As libpcap parses this syntax, many networking programs require it.

To specify a capture filter, use `tshark -f "${filter}"`. For example, to capture pings or tcp traffic on port 80, use `icmp or tcp port 80`.

To see how your capture filter is parsed, use [dumpcap](/capture/dumpcap/). Below is how `ip` is parsed.

If this intrigues you, [capture filter deconstruction](/packetcraft/arcana/bpf_instructions/) awaits.

## Capture vs Display Filters

Wireshark uses two types of filters: Capture Filters and [Display Filters](/analyze/packet_hunting/packet_hunting/). By comparison, display filters are more versatile, and can be used to
select for expert infos that can be determined with a multipass analysis. For
example, if you want to see all pings that didn't get a response,
`tshark -r file.pcap -Y "icmp.resp_not_found"` will do the job.
Capture filters cannot be this intelligent because their keep/drop decision is based on a single pass.

Capture filters operate on raw packet bytes with no [capture format](/formats/) bytes getting in the way.
You cannot use them on an existing file or when reading from stdin for this reason.
