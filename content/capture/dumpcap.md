## About

Dumpcap is the part of the wireshark suite that captures packets.
Unlike Wireshark and tshark, dumpcap cannot see non-physical interfaces like [extcap interfaces](/capture/sources/extcap_interfaces).
tshark has most of the same flags that dumpcap has because tshark calls dumpcap for much of its capture functionality.

Under high loads, there is [some evidence](https://www.networkcomputing.com/networking/wireshark-packet-capture-tshark-vs-dumpcap) that tshark drops more packets than dumpcap; however, these results
are taken from a single machine (i.e. n=1).

For normal traffic loads, the choice of using tshark vs dumpcap should depend on which flags you want to use.

## Flags Unique to Dumpcap

There are a couple of dumpcap (not tshark) flags that can be used to limit resource usage.

* <u>**-N NUM**</u>: Max number of packets buffered within dumpcap
* <u>**-C NUM**</u>: Max number of bytes used for buffering packets within dumpcap
* <u>**-t**</u>: use a separate thread per interface

## Finding The Generated Temporary File

Wireshark and dumpcap will generate a temporary file if you do not specify an output file. This is how it is able to do 2-pass analysis: It has access to a file that it can operate on. tshark will generate this file too, but won't tell you where it is.

Specifying the save file with `-w $file` is faster than creating and searching for a temp file.
