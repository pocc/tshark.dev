#### Honorable Mentions

- [tcpcapinfo](https://tcpreplay.appneta.com/wiki/tcpcapinfo-man.html): Part of the [tcpreplay](https://tcpreplay.appneta.com/) suite, tcprewrite is useful for diagnosing broken pcap (and only pcap) files. It produces a subset of capinfos data as well as metadata for each packet. Note that this is an old utility written in 2011-12.
