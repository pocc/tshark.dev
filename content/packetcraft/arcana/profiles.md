## Finding the folders

You can find the relevant folders that you have on your computer with `tshark -G folders`.

```sh
rj@ubuntu18.04:~$ tshark -G folders
Temp:                	/tmp
Personal configuration:	/home/rj/.config/wireshark
Global configuration:	/usr/share/wireshark
System:              	/etc
Program:             	/usr/bin
Personal Plugins:    	/home/rj/.local/lib/wireshark/plugins/2.6
Global Plugins:      	/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/wireshark/plugins/2.6
Personal Lua Plugins:	/home/rj/.local/lib/wireshark/plugins
Global Lua Plugins:  	/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/wireshark/plugins
Extcap path:         	/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/wireshark/extcap
MaxMind database path:	/usr/share/GeoIP
MaxMind database path:	/var/lib/GeoIP
MaxMind database path:	/usr/share/GeoIP
```

Profiles are located in the `profiles` directory of the configuration folder. On this system, personal or global configuration profiles would be located in
`/home/rj/.config/wireshark/profiles` and `/usr/share/wireshark/profiles` respectively.

### Listing Profiles

You can use a bash one liner to show the names of available profiles:

```bash
bash$ tshark -G folders  | grep conf | awk -F':\t*' '{print $2"/profiles"}' | xargs ls
/home/rj/.config/wireshark/profiles:
Default  'No Reassembly'

/usr/share/wireshark/profiles:
Bluetooth  Classic
```

## Profile Files

Each of these files consist of lines of data delimited with newlines, like a hosts file. A line is a comment if it starts with `#`.

## Creating a profile

To add a profile, all you need to do is add a folder in a profiles folder for tshark to recognize it.

```bash
mkdir -p /home/rj/.config/wireshark/profiles/NewProfile
```

Once you add files to it like the ones above, if you specify `tshark -C NewProfile`, those files will override the defaults.

## Editing Your Profile

### Guidelines

You may see this at the top of config files:

```sh
# DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE!  It was created by Wireshark
```

It might look scary, but editing config files is fine as long as you take precautions.

1. Before you start, copy your current profile folder somewhere safe
2. Follow the format used by the examples
3. If you're unsure, use the syntax verifier below after saving to make sure files are still readable
4. Do not have Wireshark open while editing config files. Wireshark loads config files on startup, so if it's already open, it could overwrite your configs.

#### Finding Default Values

It is possible to figure out what the default value is for any key, regardless of profile. For example, for key `ipv6.use_geoip:`, we can print the default preferences with tshark and grep for the value:

```sh
 tshark -G defaultprefs | grep "ipv6.use_geoip:"
#ipv6.use_geoip: TRUE
```

Current prefs can be printed with `tshark -G currentprefs`.

### Verifying Correct Syntax After Editing

You can use this script to verify that your preferences files have the correct syntax after editing them.
It will also print which config files are "extra" and "missing" per [documentation](https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsug_html_chunked/ChAppFilesConfigurationSection.html).
Note that "missing" a documented config is not a bad thing. For example, you will probably never need or use an IPX name resolution file.

## Tshark Profile Configuration Flags

For when you don't want to edit the defaults, tshark allow you to use a different config file or change values inline.

### -C ${profile}

Use a different profile folder. Note that you can have many different folders, each with their own config files.
For my [available profiles](/packetcraft/arcana/profiles/#listing-profiles), I can use the Bluetooth profile with `tshark -C Bluetooth`.

### -o ${key:value}

Override a specific setting in preferences. This flag is good for one-time changes to preferences. If you want the change the setting permanently, it is better to edit the preferences file, through Wireshark or manually.

For example, let's say you're on an embedded system where you want to avoid computing checksums, which could be potentially expensive. The system default is to have checksum checking disabled, but just this one time, you want to see if the IP header has been corrupted. Given a capture named `temp` that has IP packets:

```sh
# Default is to not check IP checksum
tshark -r temp -V -c 1 | grep checksum
    Header checksum: 0xf9cc [validation disabled]
    [Header checksum status: Unverified]
# With IP checksum checking enabled
tshark -r temp -o ip.check_checksum:true -V -c 1 | grep checksum
    Header checksum: 0xf9cc [correct]
    [Header checksum status: Good]
```

`-o` is most used for specifying a series of required cryptographic settings like [WEP](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34172493/not-able-to-set-tshark-preferences-from-command-line) or [ESP](https://wiki.wireshark.org/TShark_ESP_Preferences).
In this guide, `-o` is used for [WPA2](/packetcraft/add_context/tshark_decryption/#wpa2-decryption) and [TLS1.2](/export/export_tls/) decryption.

### -H ${hosts}

Specify a hosts file by name. Let's say that burritos and tacos found their way into our hosts file. I don't know how, but it was delicious.

```hosts
127.0.0.1       localhost
192.168.1.246   ðŸŒ®ðŸŒ®ðŸŒ®ðŸŒ®
8.8.8.8         ðŸŒ¯ðŸŒ¯ðŸŒ¯ðŸŒ¯
```

And we have a capture with 4 pings and responses to 8.8.8.8. Using -H and -Nn we can see these entries.
