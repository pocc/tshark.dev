There are many protocols that can be decrypted in Wireshark:

## Kerberos

[Kerberos](https://wiki.wireshark.org/Kerberos) is a network authentication protocol that can be decrypted with Wireshark.
Use [this guide](https://docs.axway.com/bundle/APIGateway_762_IntegrationKerberos_allOS_en_HTML5/page/Content/KerberosIntegration/Wireshark/wireshark_tracing_for_spnego_kerberos_auth_between.htm)
to generate a keytab file. To use this keytab file for decryption:

`tshark -r /path/to/file -K /path/to/keytab`

## TLS

TLS decryption, for the most part, is setting the $SSLKEYLOGFILE to the destination file of your choice and hoping that your application reads this environmental variable.

To my knowledge, these applications support it:
* Chrome (and Chromium-based like Opera, Brave, Vivaldi, etc.)
* Firefox
* Curl (and any [libcurl-based appliaction](https://everything.curl.dev/usingcurl/tls/sslkeylogfile))

Unsupported:
* [Edge/IE](http://blog.ucomsgeek.com/2016/06/decrypting-https-web-traffic-without.html), but this will likely change for Edge though as it will [soon be Chromium-based](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4501095/download-microsoft-edge-based-on-chromium).
* Safari

*If your application supports the $SSLKEYLOGFILE variable, please [create an issue](https://github.com/pocc/tshark.dev/issues).*

### TLS 1.2 Decryption

TLS 1.2 decryption has been with Wireshark since October 2017 with v2.4.2. Multiple articles exist that [document this feature](https://www.comparitech.com/net-admin/decrypt-ssl-with-wireshark/). This guide features a larger article on [Exporting files with TLS](/export/export_tls).

### TLS 1.3 Decryption

TLS 1.3 is the next iteration after industry standard 1.2, with 1.3 adopted
by [most browsers](https://caniuse.com/#feat=tls1-3) at this point. TLS
decryption is currently broken ([bug
15537](https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=15537)) when
certificate message spans multiple records. In my testing, some javascript
files (and other small files) get decrypted, but no html or css files.

## WPA2 Decryption

This section is possible due to the amazing content at [mrncciew.com](https://mrncciew.com), by Rasika Nayanajith.
If you want to get better with 802.11, start your journey here.

### 1. Get your capture

```bash
# Get a sample.pcap
pcap_url="https://mrncciew.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/wpa2-psk-final.zip"
curl $pcap_url | tar -xzv
```

### 2. Decrypt

Set the values of vars to whatever they are in your case.

```bash
infile="WPA2-PSK-Final.cap"
outfile="decrypted.pcap"
ssid='TEST1'
psk='Cisco123Cisco123'

tshark -r $infile -w $outfile \
       -o wlan.enable_decryption:TRUE \
       -o "uat:80211_keys:\"wpa-pwd\",\"${psk}:${ssid}\""
```

We can now send the result to a colleague who will not need to know the SSID/PSK.

### 3. Analyze

Let's pretend we care about TCP resets in the decrypted traffic. We can check
for it with `tcp.connection.rst` with output that should look something like:

```sh
bash-5.0$ tshark -r decrypted.pcap -Y "tcp.connection.rst"
  487  38.407227 192.168.140.1 → 192.168.140.100 TCP 112 2000 → 1091 [RST, ACK] 
    Seq=1 Ack=1 Win=0 Len=0
  626  41.687352 192.168.140.1 → 192.168.140.100 TCP 112 2000 → 1092 [RST, ACK] 
    Seq=1 Ack=1 Win=0 Len=0
  1226  52.758103 192.168.140.1 → 192.168.140.100 TCP 112 2000 → 1093 [RST, ACK
    Seq=1 Ack=1 Win=0 Len=0
```

## WPA3 Decryption

WPA3 decryption support in Wireshark is
[still in development](https://seclists.org/wireshark/2019/Mar/79).
