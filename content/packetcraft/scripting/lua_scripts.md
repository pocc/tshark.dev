Lua scripting allows you to dynamically access info that might not be available in Wireshark normally! Examples will be added at some point. <!-- TODO -->

To use a lua script with tshark, use option `-X lua_script:<path/to/script>`.  
Obligatory Hello World example, capturing one packet:

```sh
bash$ echo 'print("Hello World!")' > temp.lua
bash$ tshark -X lua_script:temp.lua -c 1
Hello World!
Capturing on 'Wi-Fi: en0'
    1   0.000000 178.33.111.155 → mbp.attlocal.net TLSv1.2 839 Application Data
5 packets dropped from Wi-Fi: en0
1 packet captured
```

## Metaprogramming

There are two libraries I came across that are more metaprogramming that lua dissectors:

* [kaitai-to-wireshark](https://github.com/joushx/kaitai-to-wireshark): Convert a [Kaitai struct](https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct) binary file description to a Lua Plugin. Only some elements are supported.
* [pyreshark](https://github.com/ashdnazg/pyreshark): Use Python instead of Lua to communicate with Wireshark. Limited to Python 2.6/ 2.7.

## Lua Dissectors

I've compiled a list of the most popular lua dissectors on github.

Have a dissector you want added to this list? Has a dissector been merged into Wireshark? Make a [pull request](https://github.com/pocc/tshark.dev/pulls).

### Repo Metrics

A ✔ is given for each of the following (in order of importance):

* **D**: Has <u>**D**</u>ocumentation in the form a README. Ideally, this includes separate installation and usage sections.
* **T**: One or more of: <u>**T**</u>est code / CICD / Examples folder
* **I**: Has <u>**I**</u>ssues opened or closed by a different user
* **R**: Has github <u>**R**</u>elease or version. Lacking one may mean that the project is not yet stable.
* **C**: Has multiple <u>**C**</u>ontributors (>1)

Star/Fork count in 2019 Aug [★] and can be converted to an in-browser javascript github API query.
Repos below are on github and have at least 5 stars. None of these repos have been tested.
