## Tshark.dev

### Writing Content

If you want to help write content, I created a long [wishlist](/nextsteps/wishlist/) of things I would like better documented or at all.

### Issues

The README on the [Github repo](https://github.com/pocc/tshark.dev) is a good place to start.

If you want to bring up an issue about a page or the site generally.

* <u>**Create an Issue**</u>: If you are familiar with github, you can [create an issue](https://github.com/pocc/tshark.dev/issues) on the repo.

There are many equivalent ways of doing this, depending on your communication style:

* <u>**Edit this page**</u>: Every page has a link in the upper right corner that can click on to see the page in github.
* <u>**Comment**</u>: At the bottom of every article, there is a comments section that is tied to github issues.
* <u>**Email**</u>: If you do not want to use github, you can interact with the contributors by emailing tshark_dev[АТ]fire.fundersclub.com. This will make a github issue that functions like an email chain from your perspective.
* <u>**Contact**</u>: If you do not want your issue to be public, you can contact me directly at rj[АТ]tshark.dev
