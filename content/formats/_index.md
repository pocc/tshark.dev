{{% notice tip %}}
If you are happy with your capture's/stream's file type, you can safely skip this section.
{{% /notice %}}

When you send packets to a file or [pipe](/capture/sources/pipe/), you
are also sending the packet and file headers. Normally, you will not need
to care about the file format of your packets. This section exists for when it does matter.

If you capture no packets and send to `xxd`, you can see just the file header for any capture type.
An easy way to capture no packets is to filter by unused [ipx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internetwork_Packet_Exchange) in your capture filter.
In this example, we use `-F pcap` for the [pcap](/formats/pcap_format/) file type.

```bash
bash$ tshark -f ipx -a duration:1 -F pcap -w - 2>/dev/null | xxd -u
00000000: D4C3 B2A1 0200 0400 0000 0000 0000 0000  ................
00000010: 0000 0400 0100 0000
```

The first 24 bytes should look like the logo up left ([capture headers](/formats/sample_capture_headers/) may differ on your system).
Of those, the first 4 bytes, `D4C3 B2A1`, are the [magic bytes](/formats/magic_numbers/) that identify the capture as a `pcap` file.

Packet-Foo has a [good article](https://blog.packet-foo.com/2015/08/frame-bytes-vs-frame-file-headers/) on the difference between file header and file bytes that goes into more depth.
